        Bar Love Triangle won the Saint-Ex barephemere competition and was
        exhibited at Staint-Ex culture num√©rique - Reims for half a year.

        It consists of over 100 equilateral triangle prisms. These prisms were
        combined to form different shapes. We used them to create a bar,
        benches, tables, a dj desk and stools.
      </p>
      <p>
        The front facing modules were equipped with rgb leds. The control
        software was running on a raspberry pi with touch screen, and it was
        written with Qt.

        Inspired by computer graphics, we decided to use the triangle as the
        base shape - most minimal and stable. Also hipsters seem to like
        triangles a lot. Inspired by New Order's Bizarre Love Triangle, we
        picked the name bar love triangle.
