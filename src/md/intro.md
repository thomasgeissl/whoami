Dear people,

I am Thomas. I love creating experiences that touch people by fusing the analog and the digital world. I believe in free software and enjoy collaborating with others. Aside from working as a senior creative technologist at [2av](https://2av.de/), I am freelancing and teaching Machine Learning at [HfG Schwaebisch Gmuend](https://www.hfg-gmuend.de/). Music plays an important role in my life, which is reflected in some of my side projects as well. I write my own performance software and tools, to make my life and the life of others easier and more fun.
