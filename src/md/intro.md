Dear people,

I am Thomas. I love creating experiences that touch people by fusing the analog and the digital world. I believe in free software and enjoy collaborating with others. Aside from working as a senior creative technologist at [IXDS](https://ixds.com/), I am freelancing. Music plays an important role in my life, which is reflected in some of my side projects as well. I write my own performance software and tools, to make my life and the life of others easier and more fun.
