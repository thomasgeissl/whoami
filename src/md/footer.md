This website is written with [gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), the source can be found [here](https://github.com/thomasgeissl/whoami). It does not use any cookies. And it is only a first quick and dirty draft. I will hopefully find some time soon to work on the design and add more content.

Some of my digital photographs can be found [here](https://www.instagram.com/thomas.geissl/), for the analog ones you will have to swing by at my place.

Please don't hesitate to get in touch via email (thomas.geissl@gmail.com) if you have any questions.

Hasta luego\
Thomas
